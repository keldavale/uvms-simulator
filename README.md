# Underwater Vehicle and Manipulator Simulator

A simulator for the **BlueROV Heavy** equipped with a **Reach Alpha 5** manipulator based on the `ros2_control` framework. Integrates Thor Fossenâ€™s underwater dynamics with Featherstone's manipulator dynamics algorithm for realistic simulations.

---

## Features

- **Realistic Dynamics:** Accurate simulation of underwater vehicle and manipulator behaviors.
- **Multi-Agent Support:** Simulate multiple agents within a shared environment.
- **Hardware-in-the-Loop Support:** Integrates BlueROV Heavy hardware including A50 DVL, and Reach Alpha 5 manipulator for realistic interaction and testing.
- **Video Demonstration:** [![Watch the Video](https://img.youtube.com/vi/VRJUbpdvPIM/0.jpg)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VRJUbpdvPIM)

## Getting Started
- [ROS2 installation](https://docs.ros.org/en/humble/Installation/Ubuntu-Install-Debs.html)

### Prerequisites

Ensure the following dependencies are installed:

```bash
sudo apt-get install git-lfs
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-hardware-interface
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-xacro
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-controller-manager
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-joint-state-broadcaster
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-joint-state-publisher-gui
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-forward-command-controller
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-ros2-control
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-mavros
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-mavros-msgs
sudo apt-get install ros-<distro>-nav2-msgs

# Replace "<distro>" with your distrubution of ros. Tested with humble and jazzy

# Install CasADi (required for dynamics and kinematics calculations)
# Follow the installation instructions on the CasADi wiki:
# https://github.com/casadi/casadi/wiki/InstallationLinux

# Initialize Git LFS and pull the necessary files for dynamics and kinematics
git lfs install
git lfs pull
```

Clone additional packages to your ROS2 workspace:

- [uvms_dynamics_ros2_control](https://github.com/edxmorgan/uvms_dynamics_ros2_control)
- [uvms_interfaces](https://github.com/edxmorgan/uvms_interfaces/tree/main)
- [sensor/GPIO transform broadcaster](https://github.com/edxmorgan/tf2_broadcaster)

### Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/edxmorgan/uvms-simulator.git
    ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
    ```bash
    cd blue-heavy-dynamics-simulator
    ```
3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    rosdep install --from-paths src --ignore-src -r -y
    ```
4. Build the workspace:
    ```bash
    colcon build
    ```
5. Source the workspace:
    ```bash
    source install/setup.bash
    ```
